# NEC Software Library Academic Use Licence Terms (the 'Terms')

# THESE TERMS APPLY TO THE LICENSEE'S USE OF THE "SOFTWARE" AS IDENTIFIED BELOW 
# (INCLUDING ANY PORTION OR ELEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE), INCLUDING ANY UPDATES TO 
# THE SOFTWARE RECEIVED FROM NEC, AND BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE (OR 
# RECEIVING ANY UPDATES TO THE SOFTWARE) THE LICENSEE AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE 
# TERMS. 

# THESE TERMS ARE A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LICENSEE AND NEC. IF THE 
# LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, IT CANNOT DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE OR USE 
# THE SOFTWARE FOR ANY PURPOSE.


# 1.	Software licence rights for Academic Use

# 1.1	The Licensee is granted a personal, non-exclusive, worldwide, 
# non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free and limited licence to use, 
# reproduce, copy, create derivate works of and/or make modifications to the 
# Software solely for Academic Use; and to use and copy the Documentation solely 
# in connection with the rights granted in the foregoing.

# 1.2	The Licensee acknowledges that, unless otherwise expressly agreed in 
# writing by NEC, the licence granted under clause 1.1 does not permit the 
# commercial use of the Software for any purpose, including any distribution or 
# resale of the Software (either directly, or indirectly as part of any package 
# or bundle of software, cloud software or software as a service product), any 
# use in collaborations between academic and commercial entities (including any 
# funding of PhD activities by commercial entities), or any non-commercial use of 
# the Software by a commercial entity.

# 1.3	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee is not permitted to use the 
# Software and/or the Documentation under these Terms for any commercial purposes 
# whilst representing that such use is a form of Academic Use. If NEC has the 
# reasonable belief that the Licensee is using the Software and/or the 
# Documentation for any commercial purposes then such use will be deemed a breach 
# of these Terms and NEC may terminate the licence granted under these Terms with 
# immediate effect in accordance with clause 7.2(a).

# 1.4	The Licensee must use the Software and/or the Documentation in 
# accordance with any applicable laws and regulations, including any applicable 
# import and export control laws, associated embargo and sanction rules and 
# regulations relating to the export of software, or materials or products in 
# connection with the export of software. For clarity, the parties acknowledge 
# that the export control laws of United States and the export/import control 
# laws of other countries may govern the use of the Software and/or the 
# Documentation. The Licensee therefore agrees to comply fully with all relevant 
# export laws and regulations, including those of Japan, European Union (and 
# European Union member states), United Kingdom, and the United States, to ensure 
# that the Software and/or the Documentation or any portion thereof is exported, 
# directly or indirectly, in violation of export laws and regulations. This 
# clause will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.

# 1.5	The Licensee shall ensure that only its Representatives use the 
# Software and that such use is at all times in accordance with these Terms. The 
# Licensee shall procure that each Representative is aware of, and complies with, 
# the obligations and restrictions imposed on the Licensee under these Terms. 

# 1.6	The Licensee shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its 
# Representatives as if they were its own, and shall not provide access to the 
# Software (or permit access by) anyone other than a Representative.

# 1.7	If the Licensee wishes to use the Software, the Documentation and/or 
# any Derivative Works for commercial purposes then it must enter into a separate 
# commercial licence agreement with NEC, on such terms as NEC acting in its sole 
# discretion requires from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, NEC reserves 
# the right to not enter into any such commercial licence agreement or other 
# arrangements with the Licensee or any third party.


# 2.	Licence rights regarding Derivative Works

# 2.1	If the Licensee develops any derivate works of the Software, any part 
# of the Software and/or any modifications to the Software, either as the result

# otherwise (each a 'Derivative Work') or any product or service that uses or 
# incorporates any Derivative Works then:
# (a)	subject to clause 5.1, as between the Licensee and NEC, all 
# Intellectual Property Rights in the Derivative Works belong to and shall remain 
# vested in the Licensee;
# (b)	the Licensee hereby grants to NEC a perpetual, fully paid-up,

    """
    Monte Carlo barostat for anisotropic pressure control.
    
    This class implements a Monte Carlo barostat that maintains constant pressure by
    attempting random volume changes along individual axes and accepting/rejecting them
    based on the Metropolis criterion.
